### Hi all 👋🏼
I'm trying to express who I am as a someone who writes software in the below.
> you can expect the content to be changed any time


I:

- **code** to express what should be done and how, for both humans and machines

- **document** things that should be shared within and across teams for everyone's mental health

- **write tests** to avoid doing same tests manually again for my future self and others (usually the future comes very quickly)

- **read** to understand why and how things are this way rather than other ways

- **play and learn** or learn and play for joy and new possibilities

- **step away** to be able to see things clearer (in different distances and angles)

- **measure** so I can see what changes are needed and how much the changes actually impacted

- **listen to** patterns especially more repeating ones to see what's going on and what to do about it

- **participate** to build a better community

- **admire** great works from who were before us

- **appreciate** what you've done for us

- **admit** current limits and weaknesses of mine

- **challenge** to explore further than current limits

- **improve** environments for better opportunities and safeties

- **build** stuff mostly to build better tools...

- **spend** time and energy for reducing repetition to save time and energy

- **fight** with perfectionism to pay attention to priorities

- **(should) beg forgiveness** whenever it's necessary

- **embrace** undesirable outcomes as a natural companion that will bring possibly better methods and outcomes

- **suffer** or at least suffered from probably whatever you went through as a normal human being

- **like** to keep pushing forward and understand occasional break times are necessary for that

- **find** it hard to finish this list naturally so I will just suddenly stop here 🤪
